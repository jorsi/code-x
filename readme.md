# [Code X](https://www.wmarksutherland.com/code-x)
Code X is a collision of text and voice generating circuits and networks of possible meanings. It is a language game that probes the binary conflict between literature and orality using the computer keyboard, mouse, and the formal characteristics of computer technology: sound, moving image, and interactivity. Structurally, Code X is based on a dichotomy of containment (interactive computer program) and indeterminacy (automated computer program). The title Code X is an obvious pun on the word “codex” which means an ancient manuscript, the title also, refers to the myriad of cultural codes that permeate our lives: linguistic codes, visual codes, computer programming codes, etc. Please note that the text for Code X is composed in "courier": courier was the coded default font for all computers in 1999. Code X, likewise, refers to orality/aurality, the nesting word “ode” found within the word "code". An ode is a lyric poem marked by exaltation of feeling. In keeping with the intermedial integrity of my creative practice, Code X is a sound poem, a visual poem, a bookwork, a gallery installation piece, and a public or private performance vehicle.

                <p>
                    <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X is an interactive exploration of text, image and sound. Interaction is directed from an exploration of the letters on the keyboard, the mouse, and the space bar. Press any letter on the keyboard to activate your performance. Press the space bar to erase the screen (page) and begin your performance again (on a new page). If the keyboard is left untouched for 10 seconds <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X will enter a random automated-mode. Moving the mouse up or down the screen in random automated-mode will change the audio pitch. While in random automated-mode pressing any letter will reengage the interactive programming-mode.

                <h4><span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X History:</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X was conceptualized in 1999 during a residency at the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, New York. A <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X prototype was created by Len Senater upon my return to Toronto, Canada. The project was copy-written at that time, and Coach House Books agreed to the future publication of <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X as a CD Rom. Programming tweaks and platform adjustments in Director file occurred throughout 2000 and 2001. The first public installation and performance of <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X was in the summer of 2002 as part of my Scratch exhibition at the Koffler Gallery in Toronto, Canada. Coach House Books published <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X (ISBN 1-55245-075-9) as a CD Rom in December 2002 - their very first stand-alone new media project. <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X was re-programmed as a Flash web site in 2009 by Jess Brouse of InterAccess Electronic Media Arts Centre, Toronto, Canada.

                <h4><span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X Concept:</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X is a collision of text and voice generating circuits and networks of possible meanings. It is a language game that probes the binary conflict between literature and orality using the computer keyboard, mouse, and the formal characteristics of computer technology: sound, moving image, and interactivity. Structurally, <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X is based on a dichotomy of containment (interactive computer program) and indeterminacy (automated computer program). The title <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X is an obvious pun on the word "codex" which means an ancient manuscript, the title also, refers to the myriad of cultural codes that permeate our lives: linguistic codes, visual codes, computer programming codes, etc. Please note that the text for <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X is composed in "courier": courier was the coded default font for all computers in 1999. <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X, likewise, refers to orality/aurality, the paragram "ode" found within the word "code". An ode is a lyric poem marked by exaltation of feeling. In keeping with the intermedial integrity of my creative practice, <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X is a sound poem, a visual poem, a bookwork, a gallery installation piece, and a public or private performance vehicle.
                </p>
                <h4><span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X Interaction</h4>
                <p> 
                    <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X is housed within a self-referential paragraph containing every letter of the alphabet. A 10 second phonetic improvisation is recorded on a loop for each letter of the alphabet. By typing words or selecting letters on the computer keyboard the performer can create visual poems and sound poems coding, decoding, mashing and jamming the <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X's paragraph.
                </p>
                <h4><span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X Autonomous</h4>
                <p>
                    If the computer keyboard is untouched for 10 seconds <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X will begin to operate in random automated-mode. <span class="colour-red">C</span>ode X will replicate interactivity producing sound and visual poems until the keyboard is touched and the interactive program is re-engaged.
